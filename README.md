# myntra-clone

A Myntra Clone project built using React, Redux, Bootstrap, and React Router. This application mimics the functionality of the Myntra e-commerce site, showcasing product listings, a shopping bag, and a summary of items in the bag.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: View and interact with a list of products.
- **Shopping Bag**: Add or remove items from the bag.
- **Bag Summary**: View the summary of items in the bag, including total MRP, discounts, and convenience fees.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsive design.
- **React Router**: For handling routing within the application.
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from a local server.
